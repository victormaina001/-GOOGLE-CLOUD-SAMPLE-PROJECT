 # Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine
   Objectives
In this lab the following tasks will be perfomed:

       Initialize App Engine.
       Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
       Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
      Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

Enviromental setup

create a compute engine virtual machine using the gcloud command line interface.
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b
gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1"--  image-project "debaian-cloud" --image"debian-9-stretch-v20190213"--subnet "default"


TASK 1: Initialize App Engine using the gcloud command line interface.
    
     (i) gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

         -during the enviromental setup the project ID you assigned is the one the that will be taken as the project parameter.
         -When prompted, select the region where you want your App Engine application located.

      (ii)Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:

            git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

       (iii) Navigate to the source directory:
             
             cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

TASK  2: Run Hello World application locally
 open up the cloud Shell command prompt which is running on your local virtual enviroment.
       
     (i) Execute the following command to download and update the packages list:
            
            sudo apt-get update

     (ii) in this step setup a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.

        sudo apt-get install virtualenv

              If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.

       (iii) Activate the virtual environment:
               
                 source venv/bin/activate

         (iv)Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies:
           
                    pip install  -r requirements.txt

          (v)Run the application:

                 python main.py
You can web preview the web application on port 8080 by clicking on the webpreview on the cloud shell.
to end the test click on  Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service.
   A hello world! message will be displayed.

   
Task 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine

        (i) Navigate to the source directory:      

                cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

       (ii)Deploy your Hello World application.
    
                   gcloud app deploy

           If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.
// comment: This app deploy command uses the app.yaml file to identify project configuration.


        (iii)Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
              
             gcloud app browse
 A url will be created after running the above command,copy and paste the URL into a new browser window.
  A hello world! message will be displayed.

Task 4: Disable the application
the application can be stopped by running this code gcloud app versions stop VERSION_ID. 
the VERSION_ID tag is replaced by the app version of your web application.

The project can also be deleted completely thus freeing up all the resources, run the following command

gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID.
